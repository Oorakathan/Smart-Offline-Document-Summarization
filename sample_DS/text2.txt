
Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro are playing a crucial role in reducing global carbon emissions. 
Many countries are increasing investments in green technologies to achieve net-zero targets. 
The cost of solar power has dropped significantly over the last decade, making it accessible to both industries and households. 
Wind farms are expanding rapidly, particularly in coastal areas where wind conditions are favorable. 
However, energy storage and grid integration remain technical challenges that must be addressed to ensure stable power supply.
