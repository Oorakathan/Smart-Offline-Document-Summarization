Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the healthcare industry by enabling faster diagnoses, personalized treatments, and efficient hospital operations. 
Modern AI systems analyze medical images, detect diseases at early stages, and assist doctors in decision-making. 
Machine learning models can process millions of health records to identify patterns that humans may overlook. 
Hospitals are also adopting AI chatbots to improve patient engagement and reduce administrative workload. 
Despite the benefits, concerns around data privacy and regulatory approval remain major challenges for AI adoption in healthcare.
